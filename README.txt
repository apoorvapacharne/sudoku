MIS: 111408040

The program has been written to generate and solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle. There are 4 difficulty levels: very easy, easy, medium and difficult.
The ncurses part does mot work properly for unknown reasons, but the code for generator and solver works very well.
The program uses a backtracking algorithm for solving and generation.
the generator randomnly assigns numbers from 1-9 to some random cells of the puzzle, checks whether the puzzle is solvable and proceeds accordingly.
