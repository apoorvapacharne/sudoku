This code has been written to solve a sodoku problem given in the form of a 9x9 matrix given by the user as input or taken from the data.txt file as an example.
	The init function initialises all the empty places to 1022 i.e. 1111111110 in binary. This value denotes the possibilities of numbers that can occupy the given block. When a number given in the question is found, that number is removed from the possibility list of that row, column and block. (this is done by subtracting 2^n from 1022, n is the number found)
